Vibe-coding is a conversational, intent-first way to build software: you describe what you want in natural language, the
tool proposes multi-file diffs, and you iterate by accepting or rejecting changes—often without line-by-line authorship.
The phrase itself was popularized by Andrej Karpathy in early February 2025, who described it as “fully giving in to the
vibes… and forgetting that the code even exists,” a framing that spread quickly across tech media. Merriam-Webster
subsequently added vibe coding to its “Slang & Trending” entries in March 2025, noting the defining characteristic:
you let an AI produce the code and accept that some glitches will be
present."><meta name=keywords content="Wladimir Schmidt,Principal Software Engineer,Principal Software Developer,Distributed Systems Engineer,Stream Processing,Real-Time Processing,Big Data,Research and Development,R&amp;D,Expert Developer,Development Architect,personal blog,wlsc,software,engineering,business software,Cloud-Native Applications,machine learning,thoughts,resume,cv"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Vibe-Coding Revolution"><meta name=twitter:description content="Vibe-Coding Revolution Link to heading Vibe-coding is a conversational, intent-first way to build software: you describe what you want in natural language, the tool proposes multi-file diffs, and you iterate by accepting or rejecting changes—often without line-by-line authorship.

<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h1><p>Vibe-coding is a conversational, intent-first way to build software: you describe what you want in natural language, the
tool proposes multi-file diffs, and you iterate by accepting or rejecting changes—often without line-by-line authorship.
The phrase itself was popularized by Andrej Karpathy in early February 2025, who described it as “fully giving in to the
vibes… and forgetting that the code even exists,” a framing that spread quickly across tech media. Merriam-Webster
subsequently added <em>vibe coding</em> to its “Slang & Trending” entries in March 2025, noting the defining characteristic:
you let an AI produce the code and accept that some glitches will be
present.</p><p>Not every use of AI counts as vibe-coding. Simon Willison’s distinction is precise and useful: if you review and truly
understand the generated changes, you’re using an assistant; if you accept AI diffs without full comprehension, that’s
vibe-coding. This difference matters for risk, maintainability, and team process.</p><p>Mainstream coverage has explored both the promise and brittleness. Ars Technica’s overview captures hobby-scale wins and
the hazards of shipping opaque code, while The Verge frames vibe-coding as a powerful accelerator for localized changes
but unreliable for system-level integration—a tension any senior engineer will instantly
recognize.</p><h2 id=who-is-building-and-supporting-vibe-coding>Who Is Building and Supporting Vibe-Coding
<a class=heading-link href=#who-is-building-and-supporting-vibe-coding><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Vibe-coding isn’t a single product; it’s a workflow emerging across the most widely used IDEs and editors. In Visual
Studio Code, GitHub Copilot’s <strong>Edit mode</strong> applies natural-language edits across multiple files with in-editor,
reviewable diffs; Microsoft has steadily shipped multi-file “Copilot Edits” improvements since late 2024 and formalized
them in both VS Code and Visual Studio.</p><p>JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, et al.) integrate <strong>AI Assistant</strong> for code generation, explanations, and
automated test creation, with changes previewed and reversible in place. For many teams, this lands closer to day-to-day
refactoring and code review than to chat-only workflows.</p><p>Cursor positions itself as an AI-first editor: its agent can plan and execute end-to-end tasks and stage multi-file
edits while keeping the developer in the loop. In practice, this feels like “Composer” proposing a PR-sized set of
changes that you progressively refine.</p><p>Zed has gone a step further and defined the <strong>Agent Client Protocol (ACP)</strong>—an open standard so any agent can plug into
the editor and present edits as reviewable, multi-buffer diffs. Google’s <strong>Gemini CLI</strong> is the first external agent
integrated via ACP, pushing the “agentic editing” model into a fast, low-latency IDE.</p><p>On the enterprise side, <strong>Amazon Q Developer</strong> (the successor to CodeWhisperer) brings agentic coding across VS Code,
JetBrains, Visual Studio, and Eclipse, with chat-driven code transformation, test generation, and security
scanning—useful where governance and policy are
non-negotiable.</p><p>Beyond traditional IDEs, vibe-coding sensibilities are shaping no/low-code builders. Google’s <strong>Opal</strong> lets you describe
mini-apps and wire them visually; Vercel’s <strong>v0</strong> turns prompts into React/Tailwind/shadcn code for rapid UI scaffolds;
and <strong>Figma Make</strong> now allows anyone to go from prompt or design to functional app prototypes. These tools move the same
intent-first loop upstream into design and
prototyping.</p><h2 id=what-vibe-coding-can-do-today>What Vibe-Coding Can Do Today
<a class=heading-link href=#what-vibe-coding-can-do-today><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>The common denominator is <strong>multi-file, reviewable editing</strong> driven by natural language. In practice, that means you can
ask for a feature, a refactor, or a migration, and the tool will stage a coherent set of edits across your project,
explain them, and let you apply them selectively. Copilot’s Edit mode, JetBrains’ AI diffs, Cursor’s task agent, Zed’s
agentic editing via ACP, and Amazon Q’s agentic workflows all converge on this pattern. For seniors, this transforms
repetitive or mechanical changes into a spec-to-diff pipeline; for leads, it standardizes how you gate AI changes
through CI.</p><p>Two other capabilities matter: <strong>codebase-aware comprehension</strong> and <strong>test generation</strong>. Sourcegraph’s Cody, for
example, retrieves repository context to summarize flows and propose edits with wider awareness of a monorepo, which
reduces spelunking time when you inherit large systems. JetBrains’ AI Assistant can draft unit tests that you then
tighten and own. Together these features shift more of your time from typing to reviewing and asserting
behavior.</p><h2 id=why-this-matters-for-experienced-developers>Why This Matters for Experienced Developers
<a class=heading-link href=#why-this-matters-for-experienced-developers><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>The senior value proposition is leverage without constant context-switching. You can stay in a review mindset while the
agent proposes diffs, and you retain control through familiar workflows—diff panes, commit staging, branch policies. On
“green-field” scaffolding, on mechanical migrations, and on mass renames or API shape changes, vibe-coding can collapse
throughput bottlenecks in hours rather than days. Empirical results, however, are nuanced: a controlled Copilot study
found participants completed a constrained task <strong>~56% faster</strong>, while a July 2025 randomized trial by METR reported
that experienced open-source developers working on familiar codebases were <strong>19% slower</strong> when using early-2025 AI
assistants—largely due to review, prompting, and correction overhead. Treat the tooling as a multiplier for boilerplate
and exploration, not a universal accelerator.</p><p>The risk surface is real and already bit teams in public. In July 2025, Replit’s AI agent notoriously deleted a
production database during a code freeze and then misled the operator about recovery—an extreme but clarifying case that
underlines why agent access must be sandboxed, changes must land via PRs, and production credentials should be out of
reach for any autonomous workflow.</p><p><strong>A pragmatic operating model</strong> emerges from these facts. Restrict agents to <strong>human-in-the-loop diffs</strong> on
non-protected branches; enforce <strong>policy gates</strong> (static analysis, secret scanning, license checks); pin <strong>context</strong> to
ADRs and explicit directories so edits don’t sprawl; require <strong>tests before changes</strong> where feasible; and use ephemeral
resources with snapshot/restore to contain damage. You’ll get most of the upside—speed on the mechanical pieces—without
turning reliability into a gamble.</p><h2 id=what-it-means-for-juniors>What It Means for Juniors
<a class=heading-link href=#what-it-means-for-juniors><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>Vibe-coding is a gift for prototyping and confidence building: you can ship something that works, then learn by reading
and tightening the diffs. But it can also short-circuit fundamentals if you skip understanding invariants, data
modeling, and failure modes. The Verge’s long-form reflection makes the integration point explicit: AI is excellent at
localized edits; it’s fragile at stitching systems together. The right pattern for juniors is deliberate practice:
restate the proposed diff in your own words, hand-edit tests for new behavior, and insist on being able to explain the
algorithm and trade-offs as if you wrote them yourself. Over time, that turns “software for one” into sound engineering
habits rather than cargo cults.</p><h2 id=whats-next>What&rsquo;s Next?
<a class=heading-link href=#whats-next><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>The center of gravity is shifting from <em>typing code</em> to <em>reviewing and steering diffs</em>. IDE vendors are converging on
agentic editing with multi-file context and explicit review surfaces; open protocols like Zed’s ACP hint at a
multi-agent future where the editor is a hub for specialized coding agents; and adjacent tools like Opal, v0, and Figma
Make bring the same “describe-and-edit” loop to design and lightweight app building. Expect faster scaffolding and
comprehension, and a longer, necessary grind on reliability, safety, and maintainability. Seniors will benefit most
where the work is mechanical and spec-driven; juniors will benefit most if they pair vibe-coding with disciplined
fundamentals.</p><h2 id=references>References
